Release Name: scriptpack-20080323

Notes:
RELEASE INFO 11.10.2008

115 script files for GIMP 2.6.

License info:
  Scripts contained in this pack are licensed under GPL license,
  either version 2 or version 3 or in some cases public domain
  according to the authors preference.
  The used license is outlined in each scripts header.

How to use this release:
   Extract the downloaded pack and copy the files to
   your scripts folder.
   * Default scripts folder under your profile is a bit
   uncomfortable to use, as the path ends to be hidden by 
   the system. The easiest way to manage your own scripts 
   is to add a more comfortable scripts path from Preferences->Paths.

This release has online documentation and single script download available
at http://gimpfx-foundry.sourceforge.net/browse26/. List of individual
script authors can be found at  http://gimpfx-foundry.sourceforge.net/browse26/index_author_name.html

CAUTIONS!
   If you practice renaming script files and are doing an
   update make sure no older versions of files are left in
   scripts paths, as it is undetermined which of the
   function versions will ultimately be called.
   
   If you have a lot of scripts already and adding these
   breaks everything, remove some scripts and try again.
   Script-fu has a limit to how many script elements it
   can handle and will not work if that border is crossed.
 
Fixing and maintenance:
  The GIMP FX Foundry developers.
